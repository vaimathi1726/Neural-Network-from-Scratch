# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

#This project creates a neural network using only numpy and pandas and attempts to show the underlying mathematics of machine learning.

#Working on the classic handwritten integer dataset from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, this 3-layer neural network predicts which digit that a given handwritten number was supposed to be.
